# QM Tweaks Collection 
(Formerly Quasimorph Double Backpack Size)

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

# About
A collection of gameplay tweaks for Quasimorph. Includes adjustments I use personally and others that may be useful to different playstyles. 
All options are disabled by default, so you can enable only what you want. 
Some changes can affect balance, so enable selectively to preserve your preferred level of challenge and fun.

The collection may expand over time with new tweaks or adjustments. If you want a feature added, feel free to use GitHub Issues for suggestions.

# Configuration
The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at

`%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\EdairTweaks\config.txt`.

There is also additional config file for custom difficulty preset

`%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\EdairTweaks\preset.txt`.

Everything can be also configured while in-game without the need to restart it.

# Requirements
